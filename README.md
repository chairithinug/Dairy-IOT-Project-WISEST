# Overview
This is a private repository for my project at WISEST lab during Summer 2018. This project is a dairy IoT, using chiefly Matlab and Arduino (C++). Matlab is responsible for gathering data from experiments and finding a calibration coefficients. Arduino programs a microcontroller board. The ultimate goal is to monitor cows' temperature and to wirelessly send the data through the internet.
